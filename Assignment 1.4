1. Describe the characteristics of Big data in detail.

I.)  VOLUME:It describes the size of data.there will be a huge pile of data stored by each individual.
II.) VELOCITY:the speed at which data is generated and retrived from a huge amount of data.
III.)VARIETY: the data stored will be in various form like image,PDF etc.which will not be alike the management of those irrelevant data
              refers to variety.
IV.) VERACITY: Big Data Veracity refers to the biases, noise and abnormality in data. Is the data that is being stored
              veracity in data analysis is the biggest challenge. 
V.)  VALUE:  The costs of compute, storage, and connectivity resources are plunging, and new technologies like scanners, smartphones, 
             ubiquitous video, and other data-collectors mean that there is a huge volumes of data  what was available even five 
             to 10 years ago.We capture every mouse click, phone call, text message, Web search, transaction, and more. As the volume 
             of data grows, we can learn more â€“ but only if we uncover the meaningful relationships and patterns.
              
              
2.Explain the possible solutions to handle Big data.

There are two posssible solutions :
i.Scale up: where this is not a recommended one which the data storage exceeds the limit the storage 
  device capacity can be added up.as well it a costly,time consuming and a complex process.
    
ii.Scale up: where here economica machines can be added up instead of adding  the data storage through devices. many number of computers can be 
   added together to share the data's.and this is the better method than scale up.which is economical as well work is distributed among 
   different machines.

3. Explain the differences between scaling up and scaling out?

SCALE UP: it consumes more money and time  as well the reliabilty will be low.

SCALE OUT:rather than scale up this will be contrast where co ordianation is better since machines were shared with work as well machine 
failure will be handled.
